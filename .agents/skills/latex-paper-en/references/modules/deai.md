# Module: De-AI Editing

**Trigger**: deai, humanize, reduce AI traces, natural writing, tone cleanup

**Purpose**: Detect likely AI-writing traces in visible prose while preserving LaTeX structure and technical claims.

## Commands

```bash
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --section introduction
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --analyze
uv run python -B scripts/deai_batch.py main.tex --all-sections
```

## Raw Script Output

- `deai_check.py` emits section-level analysis, trace scores, and optional fix suggestions.
- `deai_batch.py` supports broader batch inspection across sections.

## Skill-Layer Response

- Treat the script output as analysis, not as permission to rewrite the paper by default.
- Return `% DE-AI ...` style findings or a short risk summary unless the user explicitly asks for source edits.
- Preserve `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\label{}`, custom macros, and math environments.
- Never invent new claims, metrics, baselines, or references while smoothing the prose.

## Disclosure obligation (read before de-AI editing)

This module improves readability; it does **not** remove a disclosure obligation.
If an LLM had a non-trivial role in producing the paper, the target venue may
require you to disclose it (in a dedicated section, a checklist, the
acknowledgements, or the cover letter). See
[ai-disclosure.md](../venues/ai-disclosure.md) for the per-venue policy matrix.
Do not treat "reducing AI traces" as a substitute for required disclosure.

## Graded mode (`--tier`) and D1-D5 dimensions

`--tier {light|medium|heavy}` is **opt-in**. Without it, the default output is exactly as before. When present, it:

- **scales thresholds** — `light` flags fewer items (looser caps), `heavy` flags more (stricter caps); `medium` keeps the current thresholds;
- **enables the D1 sentence-length check** — flags sections whose sentence-length coefficient of variation is suspiciously low (machine-even cadence);
- **labels every finding with its AIGC dimension** D1-D5 and attaches a one-line teaching note (why detectors flag the pattern).

```bash
uv run python -B scripts/deai_check.py main.tex --analyze --tier heavy
```

The five dimensions are readability-oriented, **not** tuned to evade any specific detector: D1 sentence-length variety, D2 paragraph structure, D3 information density, D4 connector frequency, D5 term-context matching. Thresholds (including `sentence_length.cv_threshold`) remain overridable via `references/deai/tone-thresholds.yaml`.
